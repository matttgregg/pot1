# pot1
The first pot

This is a very minimal learning project for some Ocaml work.
The functionality is the ability to store a number of objects, and
then extract a single value in a random order.

Executables are:

* ./bin/main - A simple command line. Pass multiple values on the command line and get a randomised order back.
* ./bin/server - A simple web front end. Add values, clear the list, reset, even put the last value back on the list.
